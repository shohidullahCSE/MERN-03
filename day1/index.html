     <h3>1. Early Wake-Up Time</h3>

     <p>Successful developers often start their day early. Waking up between 5:00 and 6:00 AM gives them a head start, offering uninterrupted time before the distractions of the day kick in.

        Why It Works: Early mornings provide quiet time, allowing developers to plan their day, catch up on learning, or focus on challenging tasks while the rest of the world sleeps. <br>
        Example: Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) is known for waking up at 4:00 AM every day to get ahead of emails and plan for the day.</p>
